This project contains a set of small scripts or programs that may be useful for linguistic data processing.
Currently, it consists of:
  * **a trainable tokenizer** (written in Perl)
  * **BLEU-measurer** (written in Java)

For usage information, see the scripts' code. Further utilities are yet to be added.
